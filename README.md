# US Bills API Base
 Gathers information on federal legislation based on a query (i.e. find all bills which contain the text "anti-asian") within the United States, returning information like the bill sponser, bill number, link, date, and status, though with the capacity for more. Focuses on the Legiscan API, and but contains more flexible API classes.
